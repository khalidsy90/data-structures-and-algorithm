# Challenge Summary

### Create Pseudo class with two methods enqueue/dequeue, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
  * ###  understood the problem first
  * ### I imagined how the results should be
  * ### I wrote the code
  * ### I made the tests

  ### enqueue:

  * ### Time: O(1)
  * ### Space: O(1)

### dequeue:

  * ### Time: O(n)
  * ### Space: O(n)


## API

 - **_stack_**

    **push(value)** : adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.  
    **pop()** : Removes the node from the top of the stack  
    **peek()** : Returns the Value of the node located at the top of the stack  
    **isEmpty()** : Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

  - **_queue_**

    **enqueue(value)** : adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.  
    **dequeue()** : Removes the node from the front of the queue  
    **peek()** : Returns the Value of the node located at the front of the queue  
    **isEmpty()** : Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
